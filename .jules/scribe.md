## 2024-06-03 - [MsgReader MIME Boundary Parsing]
**Learning:** The fallback MIME text extractor `_scanBufferForMimeText` in `mailto-link-generator/js/msgreader.js` uses manual string indexing (`indexOf`) and slicing (`substring`) instead of regular expressions to parse multipart boundaries. This intentional optimization prevents catastrophic backtracking, call stack limits, and excessive memory allocations from array splits on massive email payloads.
**Action:** When parsing large text blobs (like emails or logs) where boundary offsets are predictable, prefer `indexOf` and `substring` over complex regex splitting. Added JSDoc and `// WARN:` to `_scanBufferForMimeText` to protect this optimization.

## 2024-05-18 - [Passphrase Generator Retry Loop]
**Learning:** The passphrase generator uses a probabilistic "guess and check" retry loop (`MAX_RETRIES = 500`) to satisfy length constraints (`minLength`, `maxLength`) because word banks contain variable-length words. It is impossible to calculate the exact final length before selecting the random words.
**Action:** When working with generative text constraints, check if length is enforced predictively (math) or probabilistically (retries). Added JSDoc and `// WARN:` comments to protect this loop from being "optimized" into a single pass.

## 2024-03-30 - [Image Normalization Async Traversal]
**Learning:** The `normalizeImages` utility uses a custom DFS stack traversal paired with `setTimeout` time-slicing (yielding every `ASYNC_CHUNK_SIZE` or `ASYNC_TIME_SLICE_MS`). This is because standard `querySelectorAll('img, picture')` on massive DOMs can cause severe main thread lockups, and recursive DFS can trigger maximum call stack errors.
**Action:** When writing utilities that process entire document trees, avoid `querySelectorAll` and synchronous recursion. Use time-sliced iterative stack traversal to keep the UI responsive.
## 2025-02-28 - [MsgReader OLE FAT Parsing Logic]
**Learning:** The `readFAT` function in `mailto-link-generator/js/msgreader.js` parses Microsoft OLE Compound Documents by extracting the File Allocation Table (FAT) in three stages (Header, Double Indirect FAT (DIF) sectors, and standard FAT blocks). It relies on magic numbers `0xFFFFFFFE` (End of Chain) and `0xFFFFFFFF` (Free Sector). Traversing the DIF chain requires careful boundary checks against `this.buffer.byteLength` and `header.difTotalSectors` to avoid infinite loops from cyclic chains or buffer overflows from malformed payloads.
**Action:** When parsing binary tree/chain structures like FAT, always include bounds-checking (`<= this.buffer.byteLength`) and explicit limits on `while` loops. Added JSDoc and `// WARN:` to `readFAT` to clarify these edge cases.
## 2024-06-03 - [Bookmarklet Builder JavaScript Tokenizer Regex]
**Learning:** The `bookmarklet-builder.js` uses a monolithic regular expression (`TOKEN_PATTERN`) to tokenize JavaScript source code instead of an AST parser to maintain zero dependencies. The order of the OR (`|`) clauses inside the regex is critical; strings and comments must be matched *before* regex literals to prevent division operators followed by comments (e.g., `const x = 10 / 2; // foo`) from being incorrectly parsed as a regex literal.
**Action:** When creating text or code tokenizers using regular expressions, always order the clauses so that unambiguous, clearly-terminated tokens (like strings and block comments) are captured before potentially ambiguous tokens (like division vs. regex literals).

## 2026-05-11 - [MsgReader Email Address Parsing Logic]
**Learning:** The `parseAddress` function in `mailto-link-generator/js/msgreader.js` extracts the name and email from an address string by falling back from explicit `<email>` formatting to a raw regex email match. It aggressively strips outer quotes because OLE file artifacts often leave names unquoted or inconsistently formatted.
**Action:** When extracting text structures from loosely-formatted or historically volatile standards (like email headers or OLE data), prefer a cascading approach (try structured format, fall back to regex extraction) and actively strip legacy artifacts rather than expecting strict compliance.

## 2024-05-18 - Documented Heuristic String Encoding Fallback Logic
**Learning:** OLE properties often lack explicit encoding markers. We use a 70% printable character heuristic to guess whether the raw data is UTF-8 or UTF-16LE. If a string decodes as garbage in UTF-8 (lots of non-printable bytes like `\x00`), it's likely UTF-16LE. We check both decodings and score them. There is a mitigation for short string false-positives: short UTF-8 strings can sometimes technically decode cleanly as short UTF-16 strings because of accidental alignment. If both decode well, but the UTF-8 version is very short, we assume it's a false positive and prefer the UTF-16 version.
**Action:** Documented `MsgReaderParser.prototype.convertPropertyValue` with JSDoc and `// WARN:` inline comments explaining the logic. Also documented `_readSectorChain`.
