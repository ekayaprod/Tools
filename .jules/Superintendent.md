## Superintendent - The Facility Maintenance
**Sweep Report:**
* Enforced executable bits via `git update-index --chmod=+x` on: `scripts/run_tests.js`, `scripts/bookmarklet-builder.js`, `scripts/verify_links.py`, `update_audit.js`, `update_scribe_journal.js`.
* Generated a baseline `* text=auto` in `.gitattributes`.
* Scoured global `__pycache__` artifacts, appending its signature to `.gitignore` to permanently bar reentry.
* Tagged a lockfile mismatch, elevating its severity on the task board to the `[OPERATOR]` queue.
## Superintendent - The Facility Maintenance
**Sweep Report:**
* Injected missing POSIX-compliant EOF newline to `.env.example`.
* Executed `git clean -fd -e .jules/` to purge any remaining temporary test/cache files.
* Appended Vim swap file patterns (*.swp, *.swo) to .gitignore.

## Superintendent — Clean up run
**Resolved Entropy:**
* Swept resolved `[x]` items from `.jules/agent_tasks.md`

**Persistent Entropy:**
* N/A

**Escalation History:**
* `package-lock.json` lockfile mismatch was already present in `[OPERATOR]` queue.
* Confirmed zero inbound references via grep traversal, then permanently deleted standalone `plan.md` artifact from the repository root.

## Superintendent - Sweep Report
**Resolved Entropy:**
* Enforced EOF newline in .env.example

**Hazard Log:**
* Lockfile mismatch detected against package.json. Sync required.

## Superintendent - Lockfile Sync
**Learning:** [Lockfile Mismatch] `package-lock.json` lockfile mismatch was detected on the task board, but `npm install` and `npm i --package-lock-only` showed the lockfile is already in sync with `package.json`.
**Action:** No actual update was necessary. Verified test suites pass properly on current lockfile.
